## Solution Explanations

### Question 1: Get Longest String
Validates strings by checking if they contain only valid characters and have no consecutive repeated characters, then returns the longest valid string.

### Question 2: Unique Sums
Uses bit manipulation to generate all possible combinations of numbers and counts unique ways to reach the target sum.

### Question 3: Arrays to Zero
Determines if an array can be transformed to zeros by checking if all elements are divisible by the first element.

### Question 4: Unique Product
Finds the first product that appears only once in the array using frequency counting.

### Question 5: Closest Minimum
Finds the minimum value and calculates the shortest distance between any two positions where it occurs.

### Question 6: Most Common Strings
Counts word frequencies, sorts by frequency, and returns top 3 most common words alphabetically.

### Question 7: Rotate List
Rotates a list to the right by n positions using modulo arithmetic for efficiency.
